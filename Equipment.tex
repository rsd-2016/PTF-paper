\subsection{Tank}

large grey plastic vessel

Should we line the inner surface? Stan has been investigating various
non-reflective surfaces

needs investigation into water compatibility and possible emanation





\subsection{Mechanical System}
frame

two gantries

use M11 control room






\subsection{Gantry System}

\subsection{Optical System/Head}

Shimpei

collimate/polarize the incoming light

watertight

how to manipulate?

new sources?


\subsection{Optisch Fibre}
ideal wavelength range is 350--650~nm

consider bending radius

throughput

tested three samples

selected FT200UMT

good transmission across the wavelengths tested~(378--777~nm)

seemed almost unaffected by curvature

fibre must reach several metres from laser through manipulator to the
optical head

how to mount, etc. to prevent tangles, excessive bending, etc.

\subsection{Magnetic Field Compensation}

assess magnetic shielding, magnetic compensation

GIRON magnetic shielding (http://www.lessemf.com/)

GIRON frame

Helmholtz coils, could include the dimensions, wire details,
measured resistance

could describe the testing we have done, eg. setting the voltage and
measuring the field with a handheld gaussmeter

Phidget on each gantry


coil positioning, maybe outside frame supports for coils, precision measurement of coil position

direction of current and maximum external fields

consider when synchrotron is on

control development

might have to do each scan more than once (debugging, etc.)

Magnetic field scans:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Scan 0} no current, no GIRON, calculate the the fields that are needed from the coils
\item{\bf Scan 1} set currents
\item{\bf Scan 2} one layer of GIRON
\item{\bf Scan 3} two layers of GIRON
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Light Tightness/Dark room}

Stan

caulking

air vent light baffles

painting

curtains


\subsection{Water System}
Andy and Peter

Water circulation and filtration system

degassification is a major item


\subsection{DAQ/Controls}
\label{}

collision avoidance is in place and working

collision avoidance in the xz-plane will be necessary once a PMT is in place

further testing and refinement will take about 1 week

how to mount PMTs in the tank


\subsection{Photosensor}

measure different PMTs
\begin{itemize}
\item SK 20 inch
\item IceCube 13 inch, contact Darren Grant
\item hybrid photosensor
\end{itemize}

should contact Japanese, how many PMTs and when?

LBNE has made measurements

angular dependence

magnetic field dependence


measurements before the tank is filled with water

HV and signal must reach from high voltage power supply to the optical
head
