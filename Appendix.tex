\section{Magnetic Field Gradient Calculations}
\label{Appendix:MagneticFieldGradientCalculations}

The maximum gradient in the z-component of the magnetic field in Figure~\ref{fig:bfield_1gironeffects} was calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and the minumum magnetic-field magnitudes along the perimeter of the PMT outline, and dividing it by the diameter of the PMT (20 inches = 0.508 m).
For the first plot, without any GIRON flooring, the gradient is calculated as follows:
\[[(-223\pm5 mG) - (-447\pm5 mG)]/0.508 m\]
\[=(224\pm5 mG)/0.508 m\]
\[=(224 mG \pm 2.23\%)/0.508 m\]
\[=441 mG/m \pm 2.23\%\]
\[=440 \pm 10 mG/m \]
Similarly, the gradient for the second plot, with one layer of GIRON flooring is calculated to be $ 160 \pm 10 mG/m $.

The percent difference between the magnetic-field gradient with and without GIRON flooring is:
\[(160\pm10 mG/m - 440\pm10 mG/m)/(440\pm10 mG/m)\]
\[=-63\pm7\%\]

Therefore, a single layer of GIRON flooring helps reduce the gradient in the z-component of the magnetic field by $ 63\pm7\% $.
